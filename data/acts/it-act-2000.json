    "content": "The Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) is India's primary legislation governing electronic commerce, digital signatures, cybercrime, and data protection. Enacted on 17 October 2000, it provides legal recognition to electronic records and digital signatures, facilitating electronic governance and commerce in India.\n\nPurpose and Background\n\nThe IT Act was enacted to provide legal recognition for transactions carried out by means of electronic data interchange and other means of electronic communication, commonly referred to as 'electronic commerce'. The Act was India's response to the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce, 1996, and aimed to create a legal framework for the digital economy.\n\nThe Act has been amended twice - in 2008 (IT Amendment Act, 2008) and in 2011 - to address emerging cyber threats, strengthen data protection provisions, and align with international best practices. The 2008 amendments were particularly significant, introducing provisions on data protection, cyber terrorism, and intermediary liability.\n\nKey Features\n\n1. Legal Recognition of Electronic Records: Electronic records and digital signatures are legally recognized\n2. Digital Signatures: Framework for issuance and use of Digital Signature Certificates\n3. Cybercrime Provisions: Comprehensive provisions for various cyber offences\n4. Intermediary Liability: Safe harbor provisions for intermediaries\n5. Data Protection: Requirements for body corporates handling sensitive personal data\n6. Regulatory Framework: Controller of Certifying Authorities and Cyber Appellate Tribunal\n7. Adjudication: Adjudicating Officers for determining compensation\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe IT Act was one of the first comprehensive cyber laws in the world, enacted at a time when India was rapidly digitizing. It was designed to:\n- Facilitate e-commerce and e-governance\n- Provide legal framework for digital transactions\n- Address cybercrime and cybersecurity\n- Establish regulatory framework for digital signatures\n\nThe Act has been foundational for India's digital transformation and continues to be relevant alongside newer laws like the DPDPA 2023.\n\nRelationship to Other Laws\n\nThe IT Act works alongside:\n- DPDPA 2023: For personal data protection (IT Act Section 43A was an early data protection provision)\n- Indian Penal Code, 1860: For criminal offences\n- Evidence Act, 1872: For admissibility of electronic evidence\n- Contract Act, 1872: For electronic contracts\n\nSignificance\n\nThe IT Act is significant because:\n- It was India's first comprehensive cyber law\n- It provides legal framework for digital transactions\n- It addresses cybercrime and cybersecurity\n- It establishes regulatory framework for digital signatures\n- Section 43A was an early data protection provision (precursor to DPDPA)\n- It continues to be relevant for cybercrime and intermediary liability\n\nFor organizations operating in India's digital economy, understanding the IT Act is essential, especially provisions on intermediary liability, data protection, and cybercrime penalties.",

Digital Signature is an electronic way to authenticate documents (like a handwritten signature, but digital). Intermediary is a service provider (like ISPs, social media platforms, cloud services) that handles electronic records on behalf of others. Certifying Authority is an organization licensed to issue Digital Signature Certificates. Originator is the person who sends an electronic message. Subscriber is the person whose name is on a Digital Signature Certificate. Understanding these definitions is crucial because they determine who is responsible for what in digital transactions and cybercrime cases.",
